# sign_language-glove_impairment

In the image processing technique, the image is captured by the camera and then
analysed using algorithms to give text on the display. In sign language
identification system there are many problems such as lightning condition and
the overall condition of the background. A higher resolution camera consumes
more computation time and memory. In another approach, the user needs to use
gloves consisting of flex sensors and motion tracker. Data is gathered from the
sensors and depends on the hand and finger. Another way is to use a portable
accelerometer and tactile sensors when EMG sensors are kept on the hands it
generates a different sign gesture. Signals from the sensors are fed into the
computer to identify the hand gestures and convert it into text.There are two
techniques which are mainly used for sign language detection and recognition
vision based and microcontroller and sensor-based glove. The vision-based
technique uses a camera for capturing hand gestures as images and then uses



different algorithms to analyse them for identifying the meaning of the
particular gesture. In the microcontroller and sensor-based technique flex
sensors and accelerometers are used to detect the hand gestures. The system
excludes wireless transmitters and hence is a complex system.
